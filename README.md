# Example Game
You can download the GNU GPL Licensed game "FreeDink" from [here](https://nextcloud.atlantishq.de/s/9T62K9WjpEt3AQ7) and put it into `example_software_root/FreeDink/main_dir" to test it out.

# TODO
- check local cache before loading from remote
- better image resizing, prevent stretching etc.
- async load from remote, currently the who GUI blocks during the loading process
